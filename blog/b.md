This is a sample post demonstrating what can be done with OverScore Media's custom blogging engine.

In .md files, you can use **CommonMark**-style Markdown syntax.

You can also import Vue components, like `<nuxt-link>`:

<nuxt-link to="/">Link to Homepage</nuxt-link>

Emoji using Twemoji work, too: :wink:

And so is math: (using Katex)

$$
f_a(x) = \frac {\pi} {x^{13} - \theta} 
$$

There are other things, but you may as well check them out for yourself by cloning this repo and running `yarn md && yarn dev`
